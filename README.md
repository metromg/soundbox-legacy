# Soundbox Reloaded
Live music streaming

THIS SOFTWARE IS OUTDATED AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED, DO NOT USE IT FOR SERIOUS BUSINESS!
Repository archive will stay public in case someone is interested :)

Live music streaming becomes true. Soundbox is a simple web page which streams audio data to the user clients. Everyone who visits the page, can listen to the music and control the player. And everyone on the page can upload new music to the available sounds library. The songs from the library can be added to the queue. The queue is the playlist which is played automatically in the background.

The page can be left open in a tab to listen music together with distant people, who are talking for instance in Skype. It's great for listening music together while playing video games.
